Numerical solutions to some common heat transfer scenarios

## 2D Plate with Constant Temperature Boundary Conditions
Monte Carlo based solution to a [Dirichlet problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_problem) -- [Laplace's equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%27s_equation) with constant boundary conditions.  A paper by E. M. Sparrow and A. Haji-Sheikh titled, "The Solution of Heat Conduction Problems by Probability Methods" (*Journal of Heat Transfer, Volume 89, Issue 2, May 1967*) describes a methodology for applying probabilistic methods to a host of heat transfer scenarios.  This first example will demonstrate using numerous random walks to calculate the temperature distribution across a 2D plate with constant temperature boundary conditions.
